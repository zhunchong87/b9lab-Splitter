# b9lab-Splitter
Project 1 - Splitter  Before you learn more about Solidity and embark on other projects, you need to get a taste of how your good knowledge of Geth along with your budding knowledge of Solidity and Truffle can let you create a small application.  This is the purpose of this first (of 3) project, the Splitter, a deceptively simple smart contract.  The specifications we give here below is not gospel and will be changed as you progress. The specifications are not here for you to code the perfect contract in one go while the audience claps. These specifications are here for you to make mistakes, be corrected, then make other mistakes and so on. These back-and-forth will help you for the coding part of the final exam.
